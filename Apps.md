# Mobile App programming

smartphone ~ a computer with **a limited resources** electrical power(smaller battery), not always connected to power, network, no unlimited storage(no 1000TiB racks)
[screen/hardware] <---> [OS <---> App-Code & libraries] <---> [Data]
OS -> the resource manager
lots of OOP, code-reusability

1. Why need an app?
2. Idea? Is it a good idea?
3. Design: UI mockups, e.g. figma, marvelapp
4. Development
5. Test
6. Publish & Market
7. Update


# How to debug/ask-for-help?

1. Check expected & actual scenario and see/share how that happended
2. See if any places have warnings/errors?
3. See logs! Put that in Google, StackOverflow!
4. See someone else's code for the same solution.
5. Ask for expert help! Share code and share debug console.

# Apps you need

- Xcode on Mac or use MacInCloud(i.e. a VM on cloud)
    - 25+ GB space
    - updated OS
    - avoid downloading beta
- a physical iPhone
- do you really need an app for it? making an app is costly!
- Apple Developer Programmer: No point paying for it unless you are ready to launch it to the AppStore & are about to make revenue.
